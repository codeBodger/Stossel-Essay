	<p style="text-indent: 1cm; margin: 0px;">
		The Constitution affects us in more ways than we could imagine. Because it is generally an outline for what our government can, cannot, must, and need not do, however, its direct impact on our daily lives is generally minimal. Nonetheless, the Constitution’s indirect effects on us are great. Without it, our country would likely be closer to what Russia is now; after decades more slavery and serfdom under authoritarian rulers, there would have been a violent uprising resulting in a new form of dictatorship, and eventually in further authoritarian rule. The modern Constitution does not actively prevent this<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="Morgenstern, Oskar (September 13, 1971). &quot;History of the Naturalization of Kurt Gödel&quot; (PDF).">[1]</sup>, but our history would have been much harsher without its earlier forms.

	<p style="text-indent: 1cm; margin: 0px;">
		Despite all of the good it has done for us over the last quarter millennium, the Constitution had and still has many flaws.

And in the 1960s, legislation was passed to ensure the civil and voting rights of all, though it was never an amendment<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="&quot;Transcript of Civil Rights Act (1964)&quot; Archived April 18, 2021, at the Wayback Machine.">[6]</sup><sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="&quot;Voting Rights Act&quot;. National Voting Rights Museum and Institute.">[7]</sup>. Lately, various legislation and court decisions have limited the rights of people to vote, most notably, in 2013 with <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em>, which, through removing the enforcement mechanism for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, effectively repealed the act<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="Howe, Amy (June 25, 2013). &quot;Details on Shelby County v.

	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 1cm; margin: 0px;">
		In addition to restrictions on voting rights, the Constitution’s methods for electing officials are seriously flawed. This is most evident with the election of the President, in which a voter from Wyoming has nearly four times as much power as one from California<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="&quot;The electoral college badly distorts the vote. And it's going to get worse&quot;. Washington Post.">[9]</sup>. In elections for Senators and Representatives, too, even in a state that might have a 51%/49% split along party lines, it is likely that both Senators will be from the same party, and Gerrymandering can lead to nearly any combination of Representatives<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="Haidet, Brian (June 28, 2021). &quot;Algorithmic Redistricting: Elections made-to-order&quot;.

	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 1cm; margin-block-start: 0px;">
		All in all, we, as a country, need a new amendment for electoral reform. This amendment would include four articles, each addressing different issues relating to elections: Voters Rights, The Presidential Election, Senatorial Elections and Proportionality, and Congressional Elections and Proportionality. Though this order is not necessarily the best, it seems like a good place to start.
	</p>
	<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 1.1em;"><a style="font-weight: 600;">Article I:</a> The rights of voters.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 1cm; margin: 0px 0px 1em 1cm;">
		This article would re-constitutionalize the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Though this act was largely a method of enforcing the 15th amendment, creating a new amendment with more updated and inclusive terminology, as well as more specific mention of many of the issues facing (particularly minority) voters today, would hopefully increase the effectiveness and strength of any associated legislation. This amendment would include explicit mention of the ways people are being discriminated against at the polls, including by Race, Ethnicity, Sex, Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, et cetera, as well as how this discrimination is taking place, including voter IDs<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="&quot;U.S. Appeals Court Finds Texas Voter ID Law Discriminates Against Minority Voters&quot;.

	<p style="text-indent: 1cm; margin: 0px 0px 1em 1cm;">
		This article is fairly simple. The electoral college will be disbanded; it has been demonstrated repeatedly that it allows candidates, who did not win the popular vote, and therefore likely did not have the support of most of the country, to win the election and become President<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="Edwards III, George C.

Increasing the portion of eligible voters who actually vote, through the means discussed in Article I, would also help with this problem, but it would far from solve it. Additionally, (and this goes for virtually all federal elections), the President should be elected through a ranked choice system, likely using the instant runoff method, thus eliminating, or at least greatly reducing the spoiler effect<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections explains why plurality and runoff voting methods are vulnerable to vote splitting.">[20]</sup>.
	</p>
	<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 1.1em;"><a style="font-weight: 600;">Article III:</a> The election of Senators.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 1cm; margin: 0px 0px 1em 1cm;">
		A single Senator can represent a vastly different number of people depending on the state they are from, meaning that a resident of Wyoming has orders of magnitude more say in the Senate than a resident of California<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="Sandalow, Mark (January 14, 2022). &quot;Why an S.F. voter has 80 times less power than a Wyoming one&quot;. San Francisco Examiner.">[21]</sup>. This leads to a gross misrepresentation of the views of the people. A solution to this problem could be a system of partial proportionality like the German Bundesrat (Federal Counsil), with varying numbers of seats based on population, but only within a range (in the case of the Bundesrat, each state has between three and six seats)<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="&quot;Artikel 51 GG&quot;. Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (in German). Federal Ministry of Justice. 1949-05-23.">[22]</sup>.
	</p>
	<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 1.1em;"><a style="font-weight: 600;">Article IV:</a> The election of Representatives.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 1cm; margin: 0px 0px 1em 1cm;">
		Adopting another German approach will be helpful for reforming the election of Representatives. The German Bundestag (Parliament) is elected by district, like the American House of Representatives, but their district seats account for only about half of the Bundestag. The rest are awarded to political parties to make the Bundestag proportional to an additional vote specifically for parties<sup style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 0.6em;" class="citation" title="Martin Fehndrich; Wilko Zicht; Matthias Cantow (22 September 2017). &quot;Wahlsystem der Bundestagswahl&quot;. Wahlrecht.de.">[23]</sup>. This makes more of a difference with more than two political parties and does require political parties to be written into the constitution, but the system might be able to be adapted to work without parties. Even if this adaptation cannot be made, it will at least partially solve the issue of gerrymandering for the advantage of a political party, by distributing seats to parties in addition to the districts’ winners. 
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 1cm; margin: 0px;">
		Many states and local entities have been attacking our electoral system recently. Now is the time to act, not only to get the people we want into power, but to save Democracy. This amendment will help people’s voices to be heard at all and more than they are now.
